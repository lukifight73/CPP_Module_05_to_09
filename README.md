## CPP MODULE 5 to 9 - 42

# Description:
A comprehensive C++ learning through 5 progressive modules that builds mastery in Object-Oriented Programming and advanced C++ concepts. The project evolves from fundamental CPP principles to sophisticated design patterns, covering exception handling, inheritance hierarchies, templates, STL containers, and algorithmic implementations. Each module introduces increasingly complex challenges, culminating in real-world applications like Bitcoin exchange systems and sorting algorithm implementations.

# Context:
Part of 42 Common Core. C++ learning

# Main Technologies / Skills Used:

- **Programming Languages:**  C++98
- **C++98 Object-Oriented Programming:** Classes, inheritance, polymorphism, Orthodox Canonical Form, and memory management
- **Advanced C++ Features:** Exception handling, operator overloading, virtual functions, abstract base classes, and C++ casting operators
- **Template Programming & STL:** Function/class templates, STL containers (vector, list, map, stack), iterators
- **Systems Programming:** File I/O operations, CSV parsing, data serialization, string processing, and input validation
- **Algorithm Implementation:** Custom sorting algorithms (Ford-Johnson merge-insert), Reverse Polish Notation evaluation, and performance analysis
